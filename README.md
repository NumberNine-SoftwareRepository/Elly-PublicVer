Sound feature update: tried 3 different implementations, but Elly still cannot play full conversational audio.
Encountered limitations due to using Windows 10 on an older laptop.
The new release will include broader integration across different operating systems, as well as partial compatibility with multiple versions of those systems.
The new system enables full conversational capability, replacing the previous limited, pre-structured dialogue model.
The new update will integrate all accessible or installed applications, offering streamlined command access for system operations and expanded capabilities.
The upcoming release will operate within a sandbox environment to improve stability and reduce crashes, bugs, and system-level glitches.
Future versions will utilize industry-standard cybersecurity tools for legitimate defensive and assessment purposes. Additional specialized features will be restricted and excluded from public distribution.
